# Udaipur Practical Tips

## Weather guide
Winter (Oct–Mar): Cool, dry; bring light woolens for evenings. Peak season.
Summer (Apr–Jun): Hot; stay hydrated, avoid midday sun, use AC.
Monsoon (Jul–Sep): Humid, occasional heavy rain; carry umbrella, quick-dry clothes.

## Food safety
Stick to busy, reputable restaurants and avoid raw salads or unfiltered water. Bottled water is widely available. Street food is popular but choose vendors with high turnover.

## Cultural etiquette
Dress modestly when visiting temples and palaces (covered shoulders and knees). Remove shoes where required. Ask before photographing people. Respect local customs at religious sites.

## Transportation tips
Fix auto fares before boarding or use apps. Boat rides on Pichola are negotiable; book through hotels or official counters. For day trips, hire a car or join tours; roads can be winding.

## Budget estimates
Budget: Dorm/guesthouse 500–1500 INR; mid-range hotel 2000–5000 INR; luxury 8000+ INR. Meals: street 100–200 INR, restaurant 300–800 INR. City Palace ~300 INR; boat rides ~400–800 INR. Plan 2000–5000 INR per day for a comfortable mid-range trip.
